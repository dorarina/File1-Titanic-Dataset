Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and trends related to passenger survival. By leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, the analysis provides insights into how factors such as gender, age, and ticket class influenced survival rates during the tragic Titanic disaster.

Overview of the Project
Purpose:
The aim of this project is to explore and visualize the Titanic dataset to better understand the relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes. It serves as a foundational exercise in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Handles missing data by filling or removing null values to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates visualizations to summarize and present key insights about the dataset.
Insights on Survival: Explores survival trends by gender, age, and ticket class.
Steps Covered in the Script (dataset.py)

Data Exploration:
Inspects the structure and contents of the dataset using:
file.head() to display the first few rows.
file.info() to check for missing values and data types.

Data Visualization:

Bar Chart: Shows that females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
Pie Chart: Indicates the distribution of passengers among the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd classes.
Histogram: Highlights the age distribution, revealing the presence of both children and adults on the ship.

View the Visualizations:
The script generates visualizations in separate windows, including bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:

How to preprocess datasets (e.g., handling missing data).
How to use Python's visualization libraries (matplotlib) to create meaningful charts.
How to explore and interpret relationships between data attributes.
